# MyReads Project

This is project 1 for the Udacity React NanoDegree. MyReads is a book tracking app that acts as a virtual bookshelf with three shelves:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Books can be moved between shelves or removed from a shelf using the BookShelfChanger. A user can also search for books and add them to a shelf of their choosing.


## Getting Started

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`
